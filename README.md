I created a React app that works with a Crypto API. I am showing the top 100 crypto coins. 
The app displays the names and prices. It also show if the coins price has went up or down in the psat 24 hours.

I used react router to allow the user to click a coin and be brought to a very simple page. This page displays basic info as well as fetching from aother exeternal source to grab the icon data and display it. 

You can also sort the coins by clicking the "coins" tab and sort by name.
